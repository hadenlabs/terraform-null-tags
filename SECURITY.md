# Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Bug

If you think you have discovered a security issue in any of the terraform-null-tags projects, we'd love to hear from you. We will take all security bugs seriously and if confirmed upon investigation we will patch it within a reasonable amount of time and release a public security bulletin discussing the impact and credit the discoverer.

There are two ways to report a security bug. The easiest is to email a description of the flaw and any related information (e.g. reproduction steps, version) to [security at terraform-null-tags dot org](mailto:security@hadenlabs.com).
